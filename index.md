## Greetings

Software Engineer with vast knowledge in game and software development. In my 8+ years of experience, I have had the opportunity to collaborate and take the lead in several projects of 3D graphics(image processing, AR, VR, gaming, etc.).

Some of the clients of my previous jobs were Kellogg's, Coca-Cola, Danone, Bimbo, BASF, among others.

Currently Lead software engineer at Tagwizz. Working for in-house IP and tech, and as an external consultant (also in Tagwizz) for foreign companies from the USA mainly.

Proficient in other areas(but not expert) that support my skills as a software engineer in game dev (web services, databases, backend, frontend, 3D art pipeline, 3d texturing, rendering).

I'm looking forward to collaborating with you, and I'd be glad and grateful if you consider my profile.

I love games and computer graphics.

Cheers!
Fernando Monroy

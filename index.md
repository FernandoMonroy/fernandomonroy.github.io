## Greetings

Software Engineer with a main focus on game development and 8+ years of experience. I have had the opportunity to collaborate and take the lead in several projects on different platforms (mobile, mobile/AR, PC, PC/VR).

Currently working as a software engineer for outsourcing companies providing game development services for worldwide game studios (USA, Spain, UK, India, Czech Republic).

Proficient in other areas(but not expert) that support my skills as a software engineer in game dev (web services, databases, backend, frontend, 3D art pipeline, 3d texturing, rendering).

I'm looking forward to collaborating with you, and I'd be glad and grateful if you consider my profile.

I love games and computer graphics.

Cheers!

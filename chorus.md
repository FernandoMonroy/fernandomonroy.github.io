## Chorus, Fishlabs Deep-Silver:

Chorus is a multiplatform arcade flight-sim game.

For this project I collaborated as an external software engenieer from Plan A to provide support in VFX integration. The goals achieved are mentioned next:

* Integrate unreal engine real-time volumetric effects to cinematics to achieve LookDev for main character 2nd Power.
* Modify unreal engine volumetric packages to provide real-time color lighting and velocity change, from Ryan Buck decompressed fuild effect.
* Provide support to run volumetric VFX in the unreal sequencer.
* Fix blueprint warning at material instance dynamic generation. Such logs were causing crashes on the automated render farm routines.
* Fix material instance dynamic slot assignation for skeletal meshes with multiple materials.

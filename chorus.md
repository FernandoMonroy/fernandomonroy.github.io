##
Evo Island, procedural ecosystem game simulation:
##
    - Design the overall software architecture and modules communication of the project
##
    - Implement runtime geometry generation using a custom Delaunay algorithm for triangulation and a custom Poisson disk sampling algorithm to generate point data.
##
    - Use of unity jobs and c# tasks (thread pool) to multithread specific parts of the code, mainly geometry generation and placement
